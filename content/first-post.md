Born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, William Henry Gates III grew up in an intellectually stimulating environment. His father was a lawyer, and his mother was actively involved in various charitable organizations. His love for computers began at an early age, and by 13, he was already coding.

Gates attended Harvard University in 1973 but dropped out in 1975 to pursue his passion for software development. This bold decision led to the birth of Microsoft.
